Lafore Workshop Apps
---
 
This project aims to reproduce the "workshop applets" provided in Robert Lafore's Data Structures and Algorithms in Java using Javascript and React.js. Instead of running the Java applets provided by the publisher with `appletviewer`, you can instead simply play with them natively in your browser.
 
Usage

Start the development server with this command:
 
```
$ npm start
```
  
And then go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
